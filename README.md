## [Platinum](https://github.com/orgs/modcommunity/projects/5)
Platinum (name change TBD) will act as a community suite and implement all of our current services into their own application instead of relying on [Invision Power Services](https://invisionpower.com/), which is what we're using for at this moment.

Reasons for moving away from IPS 4 include.

* IPS 4 is very feature-rich, but also very bloated which can confuse new users.
* IPS 4 doesn't officially support our web server and only supports Apache.
* IPS 4's team is primarily focusing on their cloud hosting services rather than self-hosted services.

IPS 4 was always going to be temporary, but allows us to prototype our services. Additionally, [Best Mods](https://bestmods.io/), [Gamecom](https://gamecom.io/), and [Best Servers](https://bestservers.io) will be using open source and modern technology that we will use for Platinum in the future.
